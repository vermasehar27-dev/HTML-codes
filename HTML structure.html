    <h1>What is coding?</h1>
    <p><b>Coding, or programming, is writing step-by-step instructions (code) in a specific language (like Python or JavaScript)
    that tells a computer or device how to perform tasks, build websites, create apps, analyze data, and power virtually all
    modern technology by translating human ideas into machine-readable commands. It's essentially communicating with
    computers, giving them a precise "recipe" to follow to achieve a desired outcome.</b></p>
